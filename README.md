## There's really only one way to tell you this..

-81% of the people working in the tech industry are ***male.***


And yes thats a worldwide statistic. So why is that percentage is so high?


Women not only arent represented in the tech industry but the work culture and 
gender discrimination are the leading reasons for the lack of 
gender equality in the tech industry, and not to mention the gender pay gap
affects the careers of women in tech.

Isn't that ironic considering ***Ada Lovelace*** was the world's first programmer as she worked on the analytical engine?


## So what's my proposal?

It's fair to say women deserve a community where they learn, share, teach and help eachother with creative coding.
i've chosen creative coding as the main theme as i this would not only support and empower future idols for other women 
but also create a platform for minorities in the tech industry to learn from eachother.

## ✿ Main points of this service ✿

- Being able to post your work & gain feedback from others
- Having different sections for different knowledge levels : beginner, medium, advanced ect.
- Different sections for each coding languages : java, p5.js, html ect 
- Option to post questions that would be answered by the community.
- Open source; being able to share your code and other members.
- Creators would be able to post video tutorials / stream on the platform 





⚠ this is for women and minorities like non binary people, trans people ect. ⚠
