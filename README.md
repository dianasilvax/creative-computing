# ❀ The change we need ❀
#### Like seriously..


## There's really only one way to tell you this..

-81% of the people working in the tech industry are ***male.***


And yes that's a worldwide statistic. So why is that percentage is so high?


Women not only aren't represented in the tech industry but the work culture and 
gender discrimination are the leading reasons for the lack of 
gender equality in the tech industry, and not to mention the gender pay gap
affects the careers of women in tech.

Isn't that ironic considering ***Ada Lovelace*** was the world's first programmer as she worked on the analytical engine?


## So what's my proposal?

### ╰┈➤ A community.

My idea includes an open-source community, i decided to focus on this because i just started learning how to code
it's crazy to see that all the courses to learn about code are run by men, all the youtube tutorials are made by men,
all the big tech 'geniuses' are men, women seem to be excluded from this career or anything to do with tech in general,
with not much exposure to other parts of creative computing either...

It's fair to say women deserve a community where they can learn, share, teach and help eachother with creative coding.
I've chosen creative coding as the main theme as i think this would not only support and empower women, but also giving other girls
who don't know where to start, someone to look up to. This would help minorities in the tech industry learn from eachother.

## ✿ Main points of this service ✿

- Being able to post your work & get feedback from others
- Having different sections for different knowledge levels : beginner, medium, advanced ect.
- Different sections for each coding languages : java, p5.js, html ect 
- Option to post questions that would be answered by the community.
- Open source; being able to share your code with other members.
- Creators would be able to post video tutorials / stream on the platform. 

The desired outcome would entail a website/app, with the funds and time this proposal could be possible. 

# This service is not only to help a community, but to bring people together and explore our potential ೄྀ࿐ ˊˎ-

### We can all make things like this ⁀➷
